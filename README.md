The JQK Computer Game Company (JQK) observes a steep increase in a popularity of card games. The 
company foresees a bright future of digital card games and aims at exploring this opportunity. While there 
exist many card games already, the company decides to create yet another card game called Lucky 
Thirteen. 
 
A software team at JQK has started to develop a framework for this new digital card game. The code does 
work to some extent. However, it was implemented in a rush and was not properly designed. JQK has 
recruited you and your team to revise the existing design and codebase as well as extending the 
framework to also include additional logic and features to make the game even more exciting.
